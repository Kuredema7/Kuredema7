# Kure Dema Bere

**`Content Creator | Graphic Designer | Android Developer`**

I'm a content creator and Android developer building my version of the digital world one step at a time.
All projects are built from scratch, from brainstorming, planning and designing to solving real-world problems with code.
All content articles are built the same way, from ideation, brainstorming and planning to publish them on my Facebook "[Kure Dema Bere](https://www.facebook.com/kuredema7)"
